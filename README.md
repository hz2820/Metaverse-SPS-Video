Project Information
Project Goal:
Create a Metaverse compatible video to be displayed on the Oculus Quest 2. Take a 360-degree mp4 file and import it into a Metaverse video with Unity. 


Benefit of the Project:
The project will make an 3D video for NYU SPS in Metaverse Platform with Unity. Sponsor can use it to introduce NYU SPS to students and people who are interested. It’s good for marketing department to advertise for NYU SPS.

Project Brief Description:
The project is about creating a 3D video in Metaverse Platform for tutorials use. The project will use the Unity coding to transfer 360-degree .mp4 file to Metaverse video. The project involves project management knowledge I learned from NYU SPS MASY program and Unity coding knowledge I will learn for this project.

Relationship to the Client:
NYU SPS Marketing Department is a department in school which I am studying in.
Dr. Andres Fortino is a Professor in my Program.

Objectives and Metrics：
Objective 1 - Convert the discussions with the client into a detailed specification,
including all the features and functions of this project by end of the course.
Measurement - Deliver the typed document in mid-September and discuss any changes with the client.

Objective 2 - Take the 360-degree video for NYU SPS and import it into a Metaverse video by end of the course.
Measurement - Delivery through Metaverse Platform for VR viewing with Oculus Quest 2 by end of the semester.

Objective 3 - Provide Oculus VR users with an add-on that has clear instructions by end of the course.
Measurement - Deliver the installation guide, and user manual by the end of the semester.

Objective 4 - Test the Metaverse video with Oculus to make it better and perfect for viewing and presenting by end of the course.
Measurement - Deliver the final product and post it on the SPS website by the end of the semester. 

Objective 5 - The creation of a Git Hub repository for the final project files and
deliverables by end of the course.
Measurement - Create a link for Git Hub with all the module files and deliverables so that anyone can access it. As a final step, submit the link before the end of semester.

My Role in the Project:
I will be:
The project manager for this project. I will define the project scope, set schedules,
develop the project plan, and coordinate the project.
The Communication manager: I will be responsible for all the communication with the stakeholders. I will finally present the project to stakeholders.
The person who conducts the project:
All steps in the project must be well documented as the project progresses and comes up with summary progress reports weekly.
The final deliverable must be a perfect Metaverse video, as well as instructions for installation and viewing.
Ensuring the final project files and supporting documentation to be delivered.
As a project manager of this project:
Managing the progress of the project within the timeline and ensure that     the project finish on time.
Building strong communication channel with the client and the sponsor to get them involved.
Setting up regular meeting with the client to ensure clients were being updated	the most recent information, progress, and issues about the project. (If there are issues about the project, looking for the solutions in common with the client)

Proposed Duration:
The project will start on September 1, 2022, and final version will be delivered on December 8, 2022. Approximately 325 hours in total.

Resources Required:
Detail information about how to Unity coding to build a 3D video.
Equipment like camera and Oculus Quest 2.

Learning Anticipations:
Area of MASY Study Covered:
Project Management. For this project, I will be the project manager. I will initiate the project, plan, execute, monitor/control and close the project. Similar to what I did in PM class but on a real-world project.
Unity coding. For this project, I will learn how to use Unity coding to import a 360-degree .mp4 file into a Metaverse video.

Learning Outcomes:
Project management skills.
Programming Language: Unity. 
Anticipated Project Findings:
	Potential Solutions:
		I will use the 2021.3.8f1 patch of the Unity from Unity Hub to develop
module and may quickly adapt by the future users. Also, the Oculus Quest 2 is recommended for VR viewing.
	Limitations:
Creating a Metaverse video required lots of expertise knowledge and the ability to transfer video form .mp4 file with Unity, and any other external artifacts such as 360-degree video taking. It is hard to have the best performance Metaverse video right on time, but sooner after the project finished, it will require more videos.
Video taking with camera may affected by weather and other environment factors, it may not be perfect.
